					<p>Embassy Network locations represent a pioneering frontier in new models of Home and 
					community in the 21st century. A new generation seeks spaces that nourish the soul and 
					ambition at the same time, that allow for greater fluidity of movement, more efficient 
					use of resources, while giving permission and encouragement to manifest ideas and dreams into reality.</p>
					<p>The Embassy Network connects these coliving spaces and helps them reach out to a broad 
					community of individuals who identify with a lifestyle of collaboration, openness, and intentionality,
					to find like-minded communities that they can actively plug into as they live, and travel the globe for 
					projects, collaborations and creative endeavours. </p>
					<p>Because embassies are meant to be a cultural anchor and touch point for people, embassy locations 
					need to expose some mechanism(s) for people to get involved with the space. We have observed this to 
					typically happen through events and/or guest spaces, but there are many ways.</p>
					<h3>Qualities of Embassy locations:</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Is a residential space</li>
					  <li>A strong feeling of community</li>
            <li>A semi-permeable membrane which welcomes an extended community (eg. short term guests, event space, art gallery, cafe...)</li>
            <li>Is run by and for a community (is not primarily a corporate space, even if it is a business)</li>
            <li>Combines selectivity with a strong culture of openness</li>
            <li>A culture of curiosity and questioning</li>
            <li>A culture of action, ownership, participation.</li>    
            <li>Clean, safe and welcoming</li> 
					</ul>

						<h3>Features of Embassy Membership</h3>
						<p>
						Membership and participation in the Embassy Network are offered on a sliding scale.

						  <li>A global community of spaces to call home and connect with like-minded individuals</li>
						  <li>A central directory making it easy to find and reach out to individual locations</li>
						  <li>Search room availability and event listings where you’re headed next</li>
						  <li>Exposure for your space, general outreach and awareness-raising of coliving models </li>
						  <li>Be part of something bigger!</li>

						<p>Additionally, there are optional services which have a fee associated with them, 
						that individual locations may elect to make use of:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Hosted website and guest booking sofware (rather than hosting on your own server -- additional fee)</li>
              <li><Processing of guest reservations and card payments (small percent of reservation amount)/li>
